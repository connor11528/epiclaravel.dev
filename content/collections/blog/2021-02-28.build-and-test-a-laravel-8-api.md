This is helpful because it means you don''t have to have PHP 8 installed on your machine, you only need Docker. Docker certainly has it''s own overheads and turning curve but has the advantage that local and production can look the same or have the same definitions. Using Docker for development and production makes "infrastructure as code" easier and gets us closer to that goal of continuous deployment. I hope in the next steps this will become apparent!'

        text: 'Laravel is a PHP server and web framework. This is great for sending requests from the server to clients. Anytime a user opens up a web browser and sends us a request we can respond back to them over the HTTP protocol using our Laravel PHP server. Most web applications also need software for storing data. When we ran our curl command that created our app above we specified that we''d like to set up the app with MySQL and Redis. MySQL is a structured database composed of tables. Redis is an in-memory data store for key value pairs. Reading from memory is much faster than reading from disk. In practice this means we''ll be using Redis for caching. The disadvantage of storing things in memory is they are not as persistent as storing something on disk. When a computer turns off things in memory will disappear, whereas things stored on disk will not disappear.'
