In this tutorial we''ll go through how to build a database seeder with Laravel to pull data from an API and save it in Postgres. The same principles and similar approach should be helpful to people coming from other PHP frameworks like Symfony, Laravel developers or anyone using another structured database like MySQL or MariaDB. If you come from other languages like Python, Ruby or something random like Clojurescript I hope you find value in it too to build amazing service that take advantage of a loosely structured collection of openly accessible internet data. Hooray!'
